Dernière slide présentation à mettre en phrases 

## Limitations

Some interesting countries missing from our analysis (which one would have been interesting?)
We chose some variables, (events, factors), but infinity of possibilities
Multicolinearity

## Future work?

Other events: financial crisis, elections
other factors: type of country governance: dictatorship?, democracy?, etc.
Study more specificaly the different targets/indicators of each SDGs ("subSDGs") to get a more precise view of what is impacted by what
