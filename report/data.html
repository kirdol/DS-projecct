<p>During the wrangling process: we add data to our table (D1_1_SDG) based on different other datasets and match them based on the country, the country code, and the year. The table below shows all our 9 databases that we merge to have our final table for the analysis, as well as each variable of interest that we keep.</p>

<p>As said, this is now our main dataset. All subsequent datasets will be merged with this dataset. Therefore, for all the following datasets, we want to make sure that we only keep data for the same countries and years as in this dataset.</p>

<section id="dataset-on-unemployment-rate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dataset-on-unemployment-rate">2. Dataset on Unemployment rate</h3>
<p>In this dataset, the initial step involves importing the data. Next, we ensure that the names and codes of the countries are formatted in UTF-8, preventing any discrepancies due to mismatches in country names. Following this, we modify the column names and filter the data to include only the relevant countries and years, specifically the years 2000 to 2022, covering 166 countries from our primary dataset.</p>

<p><strong>Final structure of our merged database:</strong> each country of the 166 countries from D1_1_SDG are observed each year from 2000 to 2022, thus each row has a key composed of (code, year) that uniquely identifies an observation. The other columns are the variables listed above. Due to some countries having a lot of missing information we will have to eliminate some of them, but we will still have more than 2000 rows in our database.</p>
